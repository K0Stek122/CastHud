An overlay that lets you configure and draw your own crosshairs.
Only runs on windows, and i have no incentive to port it to linux, at least yet.

It currently has 5 styles and a few basic settings:
- Thickness

- Scale
- RGB colors
- Offset
- T Style crosshair

Any contributions are appreciated! If you fix any bugs or give me any ideas, i'll gladly include the fixes.

# FAQ
## Can you get banned for using this crosshair?
I cannot guarantee 100% that you won't get banned for using this crosshair, most anticheats will be fine with it, but some anticheats (like punkbuster) do not allow the use of custom crosshairs.
