# CastHud
An overlay that lets you configure and draw your own crosshairs.
Only runs on windows, and i have no incentive to port it to linux, at least yet.

## What is it?
This is an overlay that lets you draw your own crosshair in any game that supports borderless-fullscreen.
It currently has 5 styles and a few basic settings:
- Thickness
- Gap
- Scale
- RGB colors
- Offset

# How to use it?
To use just download the latest release and run, to open the menu press insert.

# Contribute
Any contributions are appreciated! If you fix any bugs or give me any ideas, i'll gladly include the fixes.
